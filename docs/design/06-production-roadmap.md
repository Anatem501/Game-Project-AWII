# 06 - Production Roadmap

Track milestones, scope boundaries, and delivery checkpoints.

## Near-Term Scope

- Continue iterating on single-player keyboard and mouse ship controls.
- Stabilize player controller, ship controller, and camera controller modular architecture.
- Build out modular weapon/projectile content on top of the new gun module architecture.
- Add additional ship definitions to validate ship selection and ship-specific handling/loadouts.

## Deferred / Later Consideration

- Controller (gamepad) support may be added later.
- Local co-op may be added later.
- Peer-to-peer network multiplayer may be added later.
